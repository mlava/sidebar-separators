Organised your left sidebar shortcuts with separators.

**New:**
- define up to 5 different separators for your sidebar
- define the colour, width and alignment for a HR separator

Sometimes you just want some visual separation between your list of shortcuts. This extension allows you to add a horizontal line or blank space between any of your shortcuts, so you can achieve just that.

In the above image I've inserted a horizontal line after my second shortcut and a blank line after my sixth shortcut.

You can configure each separator in the Roam Depot settings. Use an integer to state where to insert the separator - it will be inserted after that numbered shortcut.

You can have up to three separators, but if there's a need I'll add the option to create more.
